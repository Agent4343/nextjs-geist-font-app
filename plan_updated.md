# Detailed Implementation Plan for Word Document Updater with Template-Based Standardization

## 1. Project Structure
- Create a new folder named `doc_processor` at the root of the project.
- Directory layout:
  - doc_processor/
    - main.py
    - requirements.txt
    - uploads/               ← Temporary storage for uploaded and processed files
    - templates/
      - index.html         ← Main UI template
    - static/
      - css/
        - style.css        ← Custom modern CSS styles

## 2. Dependencies and Setup
- Use the following open-source Python libraries:
  - Flask – to build the web interface and APIs.
  - python-docx – to read, edit, and write Word (.docx) documents.
  - diff-match-patch – to compute textual differences for redline changes.
- In `requirements.txt`, add:
  ```
  Flask
  python-docx
  diff-match-patch
  ```
- Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies using pip.

## 3. main.py (Flask Application)
- Import modules: os, logging, Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, and necessary functions from python-docx and diff_match_patch.
- **Configuration & Setup:**
  - Configure an `UPLOAD_FOLDER` (pointing to the uploads/ directory) and restrict allowed file extensions to `.docx`.
  - Set up logging and error handlers (try/except).
- **Routes:**
  - **GET "/"**: Render `index.html` with dual file upload interface (template + document to update).
  - **POST "/process"**:
    - Validate both uploaded files (template and document to update).
    - Save both files to `uploads/` with unique names.
    - **Template Analysis Phase:**
      - Open template document using python-docx.
      - Extract formatting standards:
        - Header styles (font, size, spacing, alignment)
        - Paragraph formatting (font, size, line spacing, indentation)
        - Table of Contents structure and formatting
        - Bullet/numbering styles
        - Table formatting if present
      - Store template formatting as a reference object.
    - **Document Processing Phase:**
      - Open the document to be updated.
      - Compare current formatting against template standards.
      - Apply template formatting to matching elements:
        - Update header styles to match template
        - Standardize paragraph formatting
        - Fix Table of Contents formatting
        - Apply consistent bullet/numbering styles
        - Ensure consistent spacing and alignment
    - **Change Tracking:**
      - Extract text from both original and updated documents.
      - Use diff-match-patch to generate redline diff.
      - Create HTML output showing insertions (green) and deletions (red).
    - Save the standardized document with a unique name.
    - Render results page showing download links and redline changes.
  - **GET "/download/<filename>"**: Serve files from the uploads directory securely.

## 4. templates/index.html (UI Template)
- Create a modern, responsive HTML interface with:
  - **Two-file upload section:**
    - Template document upload (labeled clearly as "Template Document (.docx)")
    - Document to update upload (labeled as "Document to Standardize (.docx)")
  - **Processing instructions:**
    - Clear explanation of the process
    - File format requirements
    - Expected output description
  - **Results section (shown after processing):**
    - Download links for original, template, and standardized documents
    - Embedded redline diff viewer
    - Summary of changes made
- Ensure accessibility with proper labeling and error message placements.

## 5. static/css/style.css (Modern Styling)
- Utilize a clean, minimalist design:
  - Modern font stack, adequate spacing, subtle color palette
  - Responsive layout using Flexbox/Grid
  - Styled upload areas with drag-and-drop visual cues
  - Custom classes for diff output:
    - `.insertion { background-color: #d4edda; color: #155724; }`
    - `.deletion { background-color: #f8d7da; color: #721c24; }`
  - Progress indicators during processing
  - Clear visual separation between upload and results sections

## 6. Template Analysis Logic
- **Header Detection and Standardization:**
  - Identify heading levels in template (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
  - Extract font family, size, color, alignment, spacing
  - Apply same formatting to corresponding headers in target document
- **Paragraph Formatting:**
  - Analyze normal text formatting in template
  - Standardize font, size, line spacing, indentation
- **Table of Contents Handling:**
  - Detect TOC structure in template
  - Rebuild TOC in target document with matching formatting
- **List Formatting:**
  - Extract bullet/numbering styles from template
  - Apply consistent list formatting throughout target document

## 7. Error Handling and Best Practices
- Validate file types and sizes for both uploads
- Handle cases where template or target document is corrupted
- Provide clear error messages for unsupported document features
- Implement file cleanup to prevent storage bloat
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Secure file naming to prevent conflicts

## 8. Integration and Testing
- Start the Flask server:
  ```bash
  cd doc_processor
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  export FLASK_APP=main.py
  flask run --port=5000
  ```
- Test with curl:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/process \
    -F "template=@template.docx" \
    -F "document=@document_to_update.docx"
  ```
- Verify standardization accuracy and redline diff generation
- Test error handling with invalid files

## 9. User Workflow
1. User uploads template document (the formatting standard)
2. User uploads document to be standardized
3. System analyzes template formatting rules
4. System applies template formatting to target document
5. System generates redline diff showing all changes
6. User downloads standardized document and reviews changes

# Summary

- Template-driven document standardization using python-docx
- Automatic formatting analysis and application
- Redline change tracking with visual diff display
- Local file processing with secure temporary storage
- Modern, responsive web interface with clear user guidance
